# Security

We are determined to achieve maximum security for all that we do at Merit Circle. This means that we aim to be completely transparent in our actions, and we work together with some of the finest names in the audit space. On top of that, actions that affect our DAO will go through multi-sig signings to ensure maximum safety.

## Transparency

We want to ensure that any possible questions that might arise analyzing Merit Circle are answered by us. We are completely transparent and strive to remain this way. Therefore, we would like to shed some light on one key function in our token contract:

**Minting function:** It's important to know that the owner of the token contract currently still has mint and burn functions. This will be voted out after the LBP as agreed with the initial DAO participants.

**Multi-sig:**  The initial multi-signature setup will be formed by the following parties (name - ETH address):

* Marco (Merit Circle LTD) - 0x08B308c486D7B9A9f9DCac1A0dc80d9d523A6967
* Marc (Mechanism Capital) - 0x953a50bd2daAa852A4Bc3E58b3AcFb95EA4E82D2&#x20;
* Michael (CitizenX) - 0x7fA32E98C5f3C8594DE1785e23905FB0C74bcCd7&#x20;
* Sergei (Angel Investor) - ​​0x15aF80290F04Ba73eDFD912b31452354eB5a4e2A&#x20;
* Balder (Maven11) - 0x8938892193FddAB15F113459E91e1c4Ab1f052A4&#x20;
* Mark (Merit Circle LTD) - 0x0ee16877560e2c08A3c0917C7e440ac9e13d0973
