# Bug Bounty

Besides Quantstamp, we invite all of our community members and beyond to start digging in our contracts in a search for vulnerabilities through our bug bounty program. We find security one of the most important factors and therefore anyone that finds serious vulnerabilities will be rewarded graciously.

## **What does the bug bounty program cover?** <a href="#6f97" id="6f97"></a>

****

Please be aware that this program is aimed at the smart contracts on-chain. Vulnerabilities found in the contracts on-chain are eligible for a bug bounty. Anything related to web front-end or whatsoever are not part of this program. However we do advise you to contact our team with these issues at [<mark style="color:orange;">security@meritcircle.io</mark>](mailto:security@meritcircle.io) — we’ll always reward accordingly.

The scope of the bounty program is limited to the liquidity mining contracts. These can be found using the following link;

### **How do you score the severity of found vulnerabilities?** <a href="#1e1c" id="1e1c"></a>

To assess the severity of these vulnerabilities or bugs, we will be using the [CVSS](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0) scoring system as shown in the image below;

### **What can I earn when I find a vulnerability?** <a href="#6300" id="6300"></a>

We believe that any serious vulnerability should be rewarded accordingly. Whenever a vulnerability is found that could result in the loss of user funds, we can reward up to $250,000. The exact breakdown of the payments can be found below;

* **Informational —** Rewards up to $500
* **Low risk —** Rewards up to $1,000
* **Medium risk —** Rewards up to $5,000
* **High risk —** Rewards up to $50,000
* **Critical vulnerability —** Rewards up to $250,000

Payouts will be made in USDC after we confirm the vulnerability and the person in question successfully cooperates with our team to solve the issues.

## **What if I find a vulnerability?** <a href="#cbf8" id="cbf8"></a>
