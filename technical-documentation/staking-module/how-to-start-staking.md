Please ensure that you only follow the official links in this article.

### **Step 2 — Connect your wallet** <a href="#a68c" id="a68c"></a>

### **Step 3 — Pick your preferred staking pool** <a href="#405c" id="405c"></a>

After you have connected your wallet, you’re ready to start staking. The next step is to pick the staking pool of your choice. In the main overview, click the large ‘Stake’ button, which will open up the screen below. This will show you the available staking pools.

\*Since 80% of the entire staking rewards will go to those providing liquidity, it’s important to understand providing liquidity on Uniswap V2 — Please scroll down for a small tutorial.

**Please understand that providing liquidity on Uniswap V2 is required to stake. Those providing liquidity on Uniswap V3 will not receive rewards.**

* When providing liquidity, make sure you use Uniswap V2 via [<mark style="color:orange;">**this link**</mark>](https://v2.info.uniswap.org/pair/0xccb63225a7b19dcf66717e4d40c9a72b39331d61)<mark style="color:orange;">**.**</mark>

Following this, press ‘Stake’ to head to the next screen.

### **Step 4 — Pick your settings** <a href="#5f42" id="5f42"></a>

You should now choose the settings that work for you. As mentioned above, you have the ability to choose between flexible and locked staking. Locked staking can increase your rewards over time depending on the duration of your lock.

After you have confirmed your transaction, please wait patiently as the Ethereum blockchain has to confirm the transaction at the other end.

### **Step 6 — Staking** <a href="#e294" id="e294"></a>

After you have approved the contract to spend your MC tokens, you have to make the second transaction to stake your tokens. Instead of ‘Approve’, you will now see ‘Stake’.

## How to claim your MC rewards <a href="#de71" id="de71"></a>

![](../../.gitbook/assets/0\_bXs0RDLH3u9Ifdvk.png)

Claiming your rewards works in the same way as staking. You simply head over to the ‘Rewards’ tab and search for the pool that shows a positive balance in the ‘Claimable rewards’ column.

Start by pressing ‘Claim’ which will bring up a MetaMask prompt (or Coinbase Wallet or WalletConnect) where you have to confirm the transaction. Please review the details and the gas fees before confirming your transaction.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/0\_jI2M9I432WjJZwRt.png)

Please be aware that rewards are subject to a 12 month lock as described in our [<mark style="color:orange;">token economics</mark>](https://medium.com/@meritcircle/introducing-the-merit-circle-mc-token-dc259dccd74d)<mark style="color:orange;">.</mark>

## Technicalities of claiming <a href="#9926" id="9926"></a>

Since our whole community is at our heart, we wanted to make sure that we’re not excluding anyone from our staking pool due to extremely high gas fees when claiming rewards. That’s why we created a different mechanism than we’ve seen with other staking pools.

To reduce calculations being done, and thus the gas cost, the amount of accrued rewards per pool share is not calculated on every deposit, withdrawal and claim. Instead rewards are periodically being calculated. This roughly improves gas costs by three times for end users. On top of that, it brings down the total gas consumed even more significantly.

This means that rewards will be calculated roughly every 24 hours depending on gas price conditions. The cost of reward calculations will be subsidized by the Merit Circle DAO.
