# Proposal Process

The Merit Circle DAO is controlled by MC token holders who submit and vote on off-chain proposals that decide what actions the DAO will undertake. Whenever a proposal receives a majority of the votes, this proposal will be implemented by a multi-signature wallet.

This means that changes must be signed by a majority of the multi-signature wallet, currently there are 7 signatories. This means that 4 out of 7 signatures are required to ratify any changes.

## Where can I talk about proposals?



Prior to making a formal proposal, several community members will already start discussion in our various channels. The main discussions are held in the following channels:
